## MapReduce implementation of distributed systems in Golang
This project is inspired by the MIT course [6.824: Distributed Systems](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/index.html) and most of the code is from the course lab assignment.

No future update. Moved to [MapReduce-With-Amazon_S3](https://github.com/BruceWangNo1/MapReduce-With-Amazon_S3).
## Usage
```
go test -run SequentialMany
